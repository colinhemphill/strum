```tsx
import { Container } from '@strum/react';
```

```tsx live name="simple container"
<Container>Hello world</Container>
```

## Props

<PropsTable sourceLink={sourceLink} types={types} />

## Breakpoint

If you set the `breakpoint` prop, your container will remain at `width: 100%` until the specified breakpoint, at which it maintain a responsive `max-width`.

```tsx live name="breakpoint container"
<Container breakpoint="md">
  100% width until I reach the "md" breakpoint
</Container>
```

## Fluid

The `fluid` prop will set the container to `width: 100%` at all screen sizes, allowing you to maintain consistent padding throughout your app without restricting the size of the content.

```tsx live name="fluid container"
<Container fluid>I take up the full width</Container>
```
