## Development guidelines

Our [GitHub source](https://github.com/colinhemphill/strum) is a monorepo containing this docs app and the React library. The README should include any relevant tips for running the project locally and working on it. Please feel free to

Strum Design System is the personal component library for <a href="https://colinhemphill.com">Colin Hemphill</a>, a front end dev in Austin, TX. I cannot guarantee any availability to work on this project, but you are welcome to post issues or make pull requests and I'll try to get to it if I can.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:colinhemphill/strum.git
cd strum
yarn

## Open-source acknowledgments

This vanity project was made possible by lots of great open-source software:

- [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) for all styling and theming. Vanilla Extract is my favorite styling solution, providing zero-runtime stylesheets with type safety, and lots of great addons like recipes and atomic styles with Sprinkles.
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for accessible primitives on which some of my components are built. Our color system is also based on [Radix UI Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors).
- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) as the basis for my `<StrumProvider />` strategies, and [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/) for his formative work in crafting the perfect dark mode.
- [Modern Normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) for CSS resets. Special shoutout to this [CSS-to-vanilla-extract](https://github.com/activeguild/css-to-vanilla-extract) converter which made it real easy to port the reset!
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) obviously.
- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) for managing the monorepo.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to produce this documentation site.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and a bunch of related libraries for documentation.
- [React Live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live) for documentation sandboxes.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/), and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

I regret to inform you that my architecture is largely based on [degen](https://degen-xyz.vercel.app/), the design system for some Web3 nonsense. Although most of my components were built from scratch, I forked from degen and still rely on much of their tech design for base styles, atoms, and documentation. They're doing great work for the wrong cause.
